    Initial release.
1.0.1
    Fixed to satisfy release requirements.
2.0
    Added a changelog.
    Changed version numbers to x.x instead of x.x.x.
    Sound Machine:
        Added pitch controls.
        Added a "Sound Machine" block (basically a sound machine that acts like a note block).
        Renamed the original Sound Machine to "Portable Sound Machine."
        The Sound Machine and the portable version can be crafted from each other.
        Changed the crafting recipe of the Sound Machine to black concrete surrounded by copper ingots (copper needs more uses).
    Fake Liquids:
        Solid liquid recipes now return the bucket.
        Solid liquids do not take nearly as long to break (for some reason I made it as long as obsidian).
        Any solid liquid with "group:lava" will set players on fire and damage them.
            Mobs are not damaged by solid liquids unless inside them (would require MineClone change or a lot of work/lag),
            but ghost solid liquids work.
        Solid liquid blocks (including ghost versions) are now closer to actual liquid blocks (swimming, drowning, etc.)
        Solid liquid blocks are automatically registered (depends on dependencies and mod load order).
        Solid liquid blocks now interact to produce cobble/stone/obsidian.
        Added Fake Lava and Fake Water, which look identical to lava and water but their functions are reversed.
            They are created by brewing water/river water or lava buckets with a fermented spider eye.
        Any fake liquid with "group:water" will evaporate in the Nether (assuming you use the bucket).
    Ghost Blocks:
        Solid liquids are now ghostifiable.
    Slime Things:
        Inner stairs are now bouncy/transparent (I just completely forgot about them)
        Upper/double slabs and inner/outer stairs no longer appear in the creative inventory
2.1
    Useless Beans:
        Added "group:useless" to all useless bean items.
2.2
    Sticky Things:
        Glue bucket recipe no longer returns bucket.
2.3
    Useless Beans:
        Added Useless Bean Armor.
3.0
    Added Minetest Game support for all mods except Lava Sponge, Meat Blocks, and Slime Things
        Some features of other mods such as Sticky Blocks are also not in Minetest Game.
    Only one global varaiable (`why`) is created.
    Ghost Blocks:
        Improved the Ghostifier wield_image and inventory_image to be more translucent.
    Meat Blocks:
        [MineClone] Meatballs fall from the sky when it rains
        Burnt meat textures are now automatically generated
    Fake Liquids:
        [MineClone] Milk is now an actual liquid. It's basically nonrenewable water. I may eventually make it clear player effects when touching it.
    Small Why Things:
        Craftable Barriers are now yellow to differentiate them from normal barriers.
        [MineClone] Added blue feathers (completely useless)
3.1
    why_init:
        Set namespace and added why:<item> aliases
4.0
    Added Useful Green Potatoes:
        Look identical to Useless Beans
        Tools/armor basically copied from iron/steel
        Useful Green Potato Liquid is identical to water but disables drowning
        Golden Useful Green Potato is identical to MineClone's golden apple (or just heals you a lot in Minetest Game)
        Useful Green Potato Block heals players that fall on it (healing is 2.5x what normal fall damage would be)
            Known issue: Landing near one is enough to trigger the healing. This is Minetest's fault, and it's either that or forcing players to land in the exact center.
        Useful Green Potato Ingot Blocks multiply fall damage slightly more than Useless Bean Ingot Blocks, and also damage players at 3 hearts/second.
    Useless Beans:
        Biome requirements removed! Useless Beans can now spawn anywhere!
    Sticky Things:
        Players cannot jump while standing on Sticky Blocks.
